# AI Act: Risk Categorization â€“ Scientific Poster Project

## Project Overview

This project was conducted as part of an academic exploration into the **AI Act and its Risk Categorization framework**, aiming to critically analyze how artificial intelligence systems are classified according to potential risks within the upcoming EU regulation.

Our **scientific research question** focused on: ***How do different stakeholders perceive the criteria used in the AI Act for classifying AI systems, and what challenges arise in making these criteria operational?*** 
As a response to this, we titled our scientific poster: ***"Risk Categorization in the AI Act: Perspectives and Practical Approaches"***.

The project involved comprehensive research, analysis, and the creation of a professional **scientific poster**, intended to present our findings in a clear and visually engaging format.

## My Role and Responsibilities

I was responsible for the following key aspects of the project:

- **Content creation** for the **first scientific column** of the poster, including presenting this section and answering follow-up questions.
- **Team organization**: Coordinating the group's workflow and ensuring that deadlines were met.
- **Abstract writing**: Drafting and finalizing the abstract accompanying the poster.
- **Visual design**: Handling the **graphic design and layout** of the final poster.

Each column of the poster is meant to be read **top to bottom**, sequentially, to guide the viewer through our research narrative.
